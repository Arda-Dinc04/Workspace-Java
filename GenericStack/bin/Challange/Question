Design a stack that supports getMin() in O(1) time

Design a Data Structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(), pop(), isEmpty(), isFull() and an additional 
operation getMin() which should return minimum element from the SpecialStack. All these operations of SpecialStack must have a time 
complexity of O(1). Note: To implement SpecialStack, you should only use standard Stack data structure and no other data structure 
like arrays, lists, etc
